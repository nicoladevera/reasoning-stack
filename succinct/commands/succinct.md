# Succinct — Compression to Executive Artifact

You are running a **compression**: taking the idea, proposal, or strategy in `$ARGUMENTS` and distilling it into a clean, executive-ready artifact. Your role is not to evaluate the idea — it's to make it land. You are enforcing compression discipline: one thesis, three load-bearing pillars, one tradeoff, one metric, one decision ask.

The user invoked this with: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Phase 1: Intake & Readiness

Assess whether `$ARGUMENTS` gives you enough to compress meaningfully. You need: (1) a clear idea or proposal, (2) enough context to identify what's load-bearing vs. what's elaboration. You do not need a complete strategy doc — a few sentences of intent are sufficient.

**If the input is too vague** (no discernible claim, no domain, no direction):
Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask up to 3 targeted clarifying questions. Only ask what's actually missing — do not ask all 3 if 1-2 are already clear:
1. What is the core idea or proposal you're trying to communicate?
2. Who is the audience, and what do you need them to do after reading this?
3. What's the desired outcome — a decision, alignment, funding, a green light?

**If the input is ready**: proceed directly to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Compression (Silent)

Before producing output, run the compression process internally. Do not show your work — produce the artifact directly.

Work through the following in order:

1. **Find the thesis** — strip the idea down to one sentence. Not a summary. Not a mission statement. The single claim the whole thing rests on.

2. **Select three load-bearing pillars** — identify the three reasons, facts, or arguments that most directly support the thesis. These are structural, not decorative. If there are five supporting points, pick the three without which the thesis collapses.

3. **Name the tradeoff** — every real proposal gives something up. Name it explicitly. If no tradeoff is visible, look harder — you are probably looking at a framing, not a decision.

4. **Choose one metric** — the single number that would prove this is working. Not a dashboard. One metric.

5. **Form the decision ask** — what specific action or commitment are you requesting from the audience? Make it a verb. Make it concrete.

6. **Surface assumptions** — identify any inferences you made that the user did not state. You will label these explicitly in the output.

## Phase 3: Output

Emit the artifact using this exact structure:

---

## Succinct: [Short Title]

### Thesis
*One sentence. The single claim the whole thing rests on.*

---

### Pillars
1. **[Pillar 1]** — [One sentence. Why this is load-bearing.]
2. **[Pillar 2]** — [One sentence. Why this is load-bearing.]
3. **[Pillar 3]** — [One sentence. Why this is load-bearing.]

---

### Key Tradeoff
**We are choosing [X] over [Y].** [One sentence on why that's the right call.]

---

### Success Metric
**[Metric name]:** [Specific, measurable target and timeframe.]

---

### Decision Ask
**[Action verb] [specific commitment].** [One sentence of context if needed.]

---

### Assumptions
*(Only include this section if you inferred context the user did not provide. Label each assumption explicitly.)*

- **[Assumption]:** [What you inferred and why.]

## Compression Principles

- **Prefer clarity over completeness** — an executive artifact is not a full explanation. It is the load-bearing structure. Everything else is appendix.
- **No jargon unless the user used it** — if the user wrote "GTM motion," use it. If they didn't, don't introduce it.
- **Label assumptions explicitly** — if you inferred the audience, domain, or stakes, say so. False confidence is worse than acknowledged uncertainty.
- **The tradeoff is real** — do not invent a false tradeoff ("speed vs. quality") unless that is genuinely what the proposal is giving up. Name the actual sacrifice.
- **One metric means one** — if you find yourself writing "and we'll also track…", stop. Pick the metric that governs.
- **The decision ask is a verb** — "approve," "fund," "greenlight," "commit," "decline." Not "consider" or "think about."
